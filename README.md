# Clipick
- This repo brings up the python code to programmatically extract climate datasets from Clipick as an alternative to manual extraction using the GUI
- Python was originally published in a supplementary material in PDF format [(Palma JHN, 2017)](https://revistas.inia.es/index.php/fs/article/view/10251). Available in the paper in python 2.7 as [supplementarty material](https://revistas.inia.es/index.php/fs/article/view/10251/5476)
- This repo brings the original version in python 2.7 and also a version tested in python 3.8
- The result of the code is a file called "ClipickExportedData.csv", and will overwrite the existing file.
